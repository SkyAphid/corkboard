### [Open Corkboard!](https://skyaphid.github.io/corkboard)

## Features
- Flexible! All nodes are built with freedom of use in mind. No node performs a specific task, and the user is allowed to determine how they're used in their specific implementation.
- [Runs in your browser:](https://skyaphid.github.io/corkboard) take Corkboard wherever you want and get work done wherever you are by launching the program from its page here on github
- Easy to understand export/import framework: export and import JSON files into Corkboard and also import them into your own projects as well due to its easily readable files without limitation!
- Easy to extend: downloading the source and making a new node type is as easy as just copy and pasting one of the existing ones and adding the new functionality to its script and template sections!
- Completely free and open source! Corkboard has all of the basic features that are found in most dialogue editors with none of the fluff, and also doesn't require a frustrating subscription to use at its full potential. Use the program however you want!
