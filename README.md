- [Runs in your browser:](https://skyaphid.github.io/corkboard) take Corkboard wherever you want and get work done wherever you are by launching the program from its page here on github
- Nodes contain rich text area features, allowing to configure nodes for coding, dialogue, or whatever is required
- Easy to understand export/import framework: export and import JSON files into Corkboard and also import them into your own projects as well due to its easily readable files
- Completely free and open source! Corkboard has all of the basic features that are found in most dialogue editors with none of the fluff, and also doesn't require a frustrating subscription to use at its full potential. Use the program however you want!
